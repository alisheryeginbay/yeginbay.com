As 2026 is coming soon I've decided to do a reflection on how things were going up until this moment.

## Groundhog Day

It's been almost 2 years since I dropped out of uni and started working full time as a developer. I think the main reason for this was a desire to be independent. As an 18 year old who was already partially working & earning I had this feeling that money was the number one thing I should strive for while I'm young.

This time was emotionally hard as even though I was able to purchase everything I wanted as a kid I saw no long-term purpose in my life. Lack of social connection that I might've obtained by being in university hit hard. It was like a Groundhog Day where you just wake up, go to the gym, work, maybe do some side projects, go to sleep and repeat the same again & again. Nothing made me want to wake up and start the next day.

## Connection

I've always found that even a little bit of time you spend with friends can lighten up your life and lift you up from the darkness. There's so much warmth in just sitting & talking about life for a few hours with no specific end goal.

Still, it took me 2 years to understand that there's no happiness in making your life goal to make more money or gaining some status.

And there's not much happiness in being the best as well. You may be one of the best in programming or have successful business or both; you will not feel complete if you don't have someone you love spending your daily life with.

There's no such thing that brings more delight than helping people, building things with great minds, being part of a community, loving someone, having a family.

## Future

So I stopped chasing false objectives. It's been a few months since I decided to fully stop working on previous projects. I find a profound joy in just tinkering around things & learning new stuff. Now I'm exploring the AI/ML field and so far I like the experience. Next year I want to meet more people, make friends, build stuff and just _live the life_.

I hope that you, dear Reader, are surrounded by people that you love and who love you. Merry Christmas and wish you the best :3
